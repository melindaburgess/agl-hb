**Sprint cycles:** A "timeboxed" effort; that is, it is restricted to a specific duration. The duration is fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, although two weeks is typical. _(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint))_

**Stand-ups:** A meeting with attendees typically standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods helps to keep the meetings short. The meetings are usually timeboxed to 5â€“15 minutes and are held standing up to remind people to keep the meeting short and to-the-point. There are three questions to ask and answer in the daily stand-up ("What did I accomplish yesterday?" / "What will I do today?" / "What obstacles are impeding my progress?") _(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective#Software_development))_ _(See also: [Features of agile](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques#daily-standup))_

**User stories:** One or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function. _(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story))_ _(See also: [Writing user stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html)), [5 ways to help user research work better in agile](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/05/29/5-ways-to-help-user-research-work-better-in-agile/))_
