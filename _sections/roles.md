The U.S. federal TechFAR Handbook offers examples of key government and contractor team members needed to effectively support Agile software development.

**_Government_**

**Contracting Officer (CO):**Authorized to bind the Government contractually and direct contractor action.

**Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR):** Performs functions specifically delegated to them by the CO in writing for the particular contract/order. This individual may also serve as the Product Owner.

**Project Manager:** Government manager of the Agile process. Also sometimes called Scrum Master.

**Legal:** Provides legal review of all documents and actions.

**Tester:** Government user to test features and functionality of the system.


**_Contractor_**

**Developers*:** Software architects who design the system and write code.

**Project Manager:** Manages the team’s execution of the project.

**Tester*:** Tests features and functionality of system to uncover software bugs in functional and non-functional areas of the system; ensures system functionality.

**Interface:** Ensures system can communicate with other systems or people as needed. This is not a required team member; membership depends on project needs.

_*Cross functional individuals should occupy these roles (developers and testers are both able to work each position). Automated testing is encouraged where the tester can write and run automated tests that are supplemented with exploratory testing.
