## Editing Content

### Markdown

### Section Metadata

Each section has a yaml header, such as the below. 

```markdown
---
title: GOV.UK on Agile
order: 400
style: black
youtube_video_id: 0XpAtr24uUQ
---
```

The metadata you can provide are:
 * __title (required):__ The section title that will appear as the section header. 
 * __order (required):__ Sort order, as compared to other sections, with lower numbers shown first. To insert a section between About Agile (100) and History (200), set the order of the new section to 150.
 * __style (optional):__ Section styling, which defaults to white background. Options: white, black, grey.
 * __youtube_video_id (optional):__ If present, this will embed a video after section content. The id is the alphanumeric code such as "0XpAtr24uUQ". This can be found in the video's URL, e.g. the bit after v= in `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XpAtr24uUQ`.
